Title: An example of a map/reduce algorithm using R and Hadoop

Abstract: R has been described as 'a DSL for statistical analysis'. Hadoop is for LARGE scale computing. Between them, they can take on a number of interesting problems - once you get them to play together. Which is actually both easier and more accessible than you might think. In this demo I will solve a simple map/reduce problem in R, and run it on an Amazon EMR cluster. 

Level: Beginner

Most relevant for: Anyone - but especially academics - who needs to do mathematical transformations on large data sets.
